Generate one personalised SMART target, recommended provision, and estimated cost per area (${areas.length} total). Each must:
- Be ADDITIONAL TO AND DIFFERENT FROM quality-first high quality teaching — no universal classroom strategies
- Have the intended outcome (person-centred, one sentence using the student's first name)
- Have a SMART target (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound — 2-4 sentences, concrete, uses student's first name)
- Have a recommended provision description (the targeted intervention details)
- Have an estimated annual cost (e.g. £450 - School Budget)
- Reference the area key exactly as one of: executive, motor, sensory, slc, social
